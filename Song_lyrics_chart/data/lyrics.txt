Book keepers, butchers
Ladies' men, school teachers
Kissed sweethearts
A row of pansies
Kids in the treehouse
Proud parents
It'll all be over by Christmas
Oh, for one last bowl of borscht
Glass of beer
Cup of Rosie Lee
Up and over (forward!)
Forget your fear, the guns at your back scream (forward!)
Who gives a fuck if your enemy's starving? (forward!)
No place for cowards, up and over (forward!)
Your country needs you, so start killing
Bells ringing
Enjoy a good shit with a paper
Class photos
Knowing everyone in the pub's name
Beaming wives
It'll all be over by Christmas
Oh, for one last
Spotted dick
Pierog
Slice of Stollen cake
Up and over (forward!)
Forget your fear, the guns at your back scream (forward!)
Who gives a fuck if your enemy's starving? (Forward!)
Onward through the stench of death, screaming (forward!)
Your country needs you, so start killing
Forward
Forward
Forward
Forget your fear
The guards at your back scream
Forward
